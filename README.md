# hyper-express-js-boilerplate
Boilerplate for hyper-express/express node js web applications.

The [index.js](index.js) file contains the [hyper-express](https://github.com/kartikk221/hyper-express) version of the main file and [indexE.js](indexE.js) is the express version. A ".env" file, following the stucture of [ex_dotenv.txt](ex_dotenv.txt), should added to the base directory, and [config.js](config.js) should be adjusted as needed. Uses mongoose for MongoDB as the database and EJS for templating.

Working on adding docs here, but all additions are in [utils](utils) and have method comments.
